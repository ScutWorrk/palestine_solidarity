                    <h3>Early 20th Century</h3>
                    <h4>Balfour Declaration (1917)</h4>
                    <p>The Balfour Declaration, issued by the British government in 1917, supported the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire. This declaration, written in a letter to a prominent Jewish leader, was a significant step towards the eventual establishment of the State of Israel.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>A large-scale Jewish migration to Palestine began, accelerated by Jewish people fleeing Nazism in Europe. Between 1918 and 1947, the Jewish population in Palestine increased from 6 percent to 33 percent.</p>

                    <h3>Mid-20th Century</h3>
                    <h4>UN Partition Plan (1947)</h4>
                    <p>As violence ravaged Palestine, the matter was referred to the newly formed United Nations. In 1947, the UN adopted Resolution 181, which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, handing over about 55 percent of the land to Jews. Arabs were granted 45 percent of the land, while Jerusalem was declared a separate internationalised territory.</p>

                    <h4>The Nakba</h4>
                    <p>Leading up to Israel’s birth in 1948, more than 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homes by Zionist militias. This mass exodus came to be known as the Nakba or catastrophe.</p>

                    <h3>Recent History</h3>
                    <h4>Israel-Hamas ceasefire</h4>
                    <p>The deal includes a temporary ceasefire that will, for now, bring to an end the destruction visited upon Gaza, as well as the release of captives held in Gaza and many of the prisoners held by Israel. The deal will also, finally, allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes – though after Israel’s deliberate destruction campaign, many homes no longer remain.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The initial phase will last six weeks, and will involve a limited prisoner exchange, the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops in Gaza and a surge of aid into the enclave.</p>
