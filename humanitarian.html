                    <h4>Mobile clinics in the West Bank: Supporting healthcare access for marginalised communities in Area C</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p><img src="img/mapkey area.jpg" alt="mapkey" style="float: left; padding-right: 4px;">
                        Discriminatory policies imposed by the Israeli authorities mean that there are no permanent healthcare facilities for almost 300,000 Palestinians in Area C, the 60% of the occupied West Bank that remains under full Israeli military and civil control. To ensure that Palestinians in Area C do have access to healthcare, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) partners with the Palestinian Medical Relief Society (PMRS) to provide mobile clinics to marginalised communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>Israel wields its perpetual control over all planning, building and movement in Area C in ways that systematically privilege Israelis living in these areas over the rights of the Palestinian population. There are now more than 465,000 Israelis living in some 279 settlements and ‘outposts’ in Area C, all illegal under international law, the vast majority of whom benefit from the government-facilitated development of modern infrastructure such as roads, hospitals and clinics, schools, and shopping malls.

                    <hr>
                    <p>The protracted crisis in the State of Palestine has resulted in unsafe learning environments for millions of Palestinian girls and boys. Travelling to school is unsafe for students, and schools are frequently attacked or occupied for military purposes.</p>
                    <p>Education Cannot Wait (ECW) has been supporting education programmes in the State of Palestine since 2018. The Fund supports partners to strengthen the academic infrastructure; support educators; and provide ongoing training to address the academic and psychosocial needs of students.</p>
